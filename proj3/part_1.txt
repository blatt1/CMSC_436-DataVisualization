    - Group idea
        We were trying to avoid the cluttering, no. 2 in the problem list.
        The solution involve :
          + Combine the curves/lines those are within 75 percentile and 25 percentile and hide the details.
          + Display the curves with darker color.

    - Solution sketch
        please see the diagram

    - Pros and Cons
        Pros
            It hide the details on overview.
            Outliers are easy to be spotted.
            Can be zoomed-in if the user needs details.

        Cons
            Implementation the idea will be complected.
            It does not show  mean values.

 - Design choices. Why is box and whisker plot good/bad?
	Whisker plots are easier to implement.
        It shows detail even on the overview level.
        It shows 75 percentile, 25 percentile, minimum, maximum and mean values

 - Steps to produce your visualization
        Understand the data.
        Understand parallel coordinates visualization.
        Understand whisker plot.
        Study d3.js.
            How to load data.
            Creating Axis and Scale them.
            Implement Whisker plot in d3.js
            Implement multiple whisker plots.

 - What went wrong?
        Ran out of time while implementing the whisker plot in d3.js
        d3's syntax is different common programming languages and it is not easy to understand for the beginners.

 - What would you change in the future?
        I'd learn d3.js first. Implement a couple of prototypes before working on the actual project.
        Whisker plot idea is perfect and simple enough for this data.
